# Surfs Up Climate Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to pull the temperature data for the island of Oahu for the months of June and Decemeber to confirm whether opening an Ice Cream and Surf Shop is a sustainable business year round. Python and SQLAlchemy were used to pull the needed information from the provided hawaii.sqlite database.

## Results

* The results show the average temperature for June is only 3 degrees warmer than the average temperature for December
  - 74.9 degrees vs 71.0 degrees
* The minimum temperatures were slightly farther apart with Junes lowest temperature being 8 degrees higher than Decembers lowest temperature
  - 64.0 degrees vs 56.0 degrees
* In comparison the highest temperatures only differed by 2 degrees
 - 85.0 degrees vs 83.0 degrees

## Summary

Overall, the data shows the temperatures don't vary wildly between June and December in this area so from that perspective the shop may be viable as a year round business. However, further analysis would be needed before committing to investing in the shop. It would be beneficial to confirm the amount of precipitation over these months as well as the wind speed, cloud coverage, and humidity as these could all factor into whether people will be likely to be at the beach (and utlizing the ice cream and/or surf shop).
